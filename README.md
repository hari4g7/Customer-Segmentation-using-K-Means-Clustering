**Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**

**Project Overview:**

Businesses often have many customers, and each customer has different purchasing habits. Treating every customer in the same way may not give good results. So, this project uses K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to divide customers into different groups (segments) based on their spending patterns and behavior.
This helps businesses understand customer needs and plan marketing strategies more effectively.

**Objective:**

1.To analyze customer data.

2.To form meaningful customer groups using K-Means Clustering.

3.To understand the behavior of each customer segment.

4.To help businesses target customers in a better and more personalized way.

**Dataset:**

The dataset typically includes the following customer details:

1.Customer ID

2.Age

3.Gender

4.Annual Income

5.Spending Score

**Methodology:**

**Data Collection**

Collected customer data containing income and spending patterns.

**Data Preprocessing**

1.Handled missing values (if any)

2.Selected important features for clustering

3.Scaled data to improve clustering performance

**Elbow Method**

Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (k value).

**K-Means Clustering**

Applied K-Means algorithm to segment customers into groups.

**Visualization**

Visualized clusters using scatter plots to understand customer segments.

**Tools & Technologies:**

1.Python	

2.NumPy / Pandas for Data handling & preprocessing

3.Matplotlib / Seaborn for Data visualization

4.Scikit-Learn

**Results:**

1.The customers were successfully divided into clusters.

2.Each cluster represents a specific customer type such as:

   a.Low Income, Low Spending customers
   
   b.High Income, High Spending customers
   
   c.Average spenders, etc.
   
3.This segmentation can help a business:

   a.Run targeted advertisements
   
   b.Improve customer satisfaction
   
   c.Increase sales

**Conclusion:**

    K-Means Clustering is a powerful technique to identify meaningful groups in customer data.By understanding different customer behaviors, businesses can make smart marketing decisions, offer personalized services, and improve overall growth.   

**Future Enhancements:**

1.Include more customer features (e.g., online shopping behavior)

2.Use advanced clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering

3.Build a dashboard for real-time customer insights
